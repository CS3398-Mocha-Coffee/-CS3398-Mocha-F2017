README.txt for Team Mocha GUI for main menu, pantry menu, recipe menu

*********************************************************************************************************************************
************************************************ UPDATE - 04NOV2017 *************************************************************
*********************************************************************************************************************************

I completely restructured the code for the GUI.  I have now added three classes to the src under pantryPlanner they are as follows: common: this is where code that is not GUI related goes.  views: this is where the GUI is located.  resources: this is where you put .png for logos or other resources to keep all data enclosed in the app.  This should make the integration of the recipe and pantry databases easier.

*********************************************************************************************************************************


*****TODO: The Group needs to decide if the login is going to be the first thing that is done and "driving the boat" for the app.
********** Or do we allow some functionality while not having a user signed in?

*****TODO: Need to link both the recipe/pantry menu buttons to desired actions with the databases
