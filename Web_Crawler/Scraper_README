##What this does (so far):
Extracts recipe name, cook time, prep time, total time and ingredients from a recipe page on (www.allrecipes.com)

##What still needs to be done:
-Create an Abstract Scraper Class
-make Scraper.py an extension of the Abstract Scraper Class
-extract cooking directions from (www.allrecipes.com)
-crawl allrecipes.com for more recipes
-export extracted data into CSV file with proper fields.
