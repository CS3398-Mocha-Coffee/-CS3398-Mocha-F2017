README.txt for Team Mocha GUI for main menu, pantry menu, recipe menu

This GUI will serve as the interface for user interactions as well as the FOC.

*****TODO: The Group needs to decide if the login is going to be the first thing that is done and "driving the boat" for the app.
********** Or do we allow some functionality while not having a user signed in?

*****TODO: Need to link both the recipe/pantry menu buttons to desired actions with the databases

*****In-progress:  Making the GUI more astetically pleasing.
*****************  I have downloaded Eclipse WindowBuilder to help with the GUI design and layout.
